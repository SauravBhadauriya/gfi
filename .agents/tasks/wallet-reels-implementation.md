# Wallet & Reels Screen Implementation - Completed

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented all requested features for the wallet & history screen and gully reel screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. **UserService Enhancement** 
**File:** `src/api/services/userService.ts`

- Added `toggleFollowUser(userId: string)` function
- Integrated with backend endpoint: `user/{userId}/follow`
- Returns API response with success/failure status
- Exported in userService object for use across the app

**Purpose:** Enable follow/unfollow functionality for reels

---

### 2. **ReelsScreen Real Data & Follow Integration**
**File:** `src/screens/ReelsScreen.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- **Fixed Imports:** Updated to import `Reel` type directly from `reelsService` instead of old types file
- **Added User Service:** Imported `userService` for follow functionality
- **Real Data Display:**
  - Changed hardcoded comment count "45" → `item.comments` (real backend data)
  - Changed hardcoded share count "23" → `item.shares` (real backend data)
  - Changed user name from hardcoded "DancerPro" → `item.username` (real creator name)
- **Follow/Unfollow Functionality:**
  - Added `followStates` state to track follow status per reel
  - Implemented `handleFollowToggle()` function that calls backend API
  - Follow button now dynamically shows "Follow" or "Following" based on state
  - Styled to show different appearance when following (semi-transparent orange with border)
- **Creator ID Passing:**
  - Pass `item.userId` as `creatorId` prop to TipPopup component
  - Enable backend payment processing in support flow
- **Video Source Fix:**
  - Fixed video URL access: changed `(item as any).videoUrl` → `item.video?.uri`
  - Properly accesses normalized Reel object structure

#### Impact:
- Reels now display real data from backend instead of dummy placeholders
- Follow button is fully functional and integrated with backend
- Support flow has creator information needed for payment processing

### 3. **TipComponents Insufficient Funds Navigation**
**File:** `src/components/tip/TipComponents.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- **Added Router Import:** Imported `router` from `expo-router`
- **Updated handleBuyCoins():** 
  - Replaced alert-based flow with direct navigation
  - Now calls `router.push('/(main)/coins')` to navigate to wallet screen
  - Closes insufficient coins modal before navigating
  - User is taken directly to coins screen to add money

#### Impact:
- Seamless UX: When user has insufficient coins to support/tip, they're redirected to wallet screen
- User can immediately add money and return to support creator
- No interruption with alerts

---

### 4. **Coins Screen "Add Money" Button Integration**
**File:** `app/(main)/coins.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- **Added Balance Buttons Container:**
  - Created `balanceButtonsContainer` View to group action buttons
  - Positioned inside the balance card gradient for above-the-fold visibility
  - No need to scroll to access primary action

- **Add GFI Coins Button:**
  - Prominent button with orange gradient (`#FF6B35` to `#FF8C00`)
  - Text: "+ Add GFI Coins"
  - Calls existing `handleAddMoney()` handler
  - Routes to `/(main)/add-money` screen

- **Layout Improvement:**
  - Both "Add Money" and "Withdraw" buttons displayed side-by-side
  - Clear visual hierarchy
  - Responsive design adapts to screen size

#### Added Styles:
- `balanceButtonsContainer`: Container with gap for spacing
- `addMoneyButton`: Main button styling
- `addMoneyGradient`: Gradient background
- `addMoneyButtonText`: Button text styling

#### Impact:
- Primary action ("Add Money") is immediately visible without scrolling
- Users can quickly add coins to their wallet
- Improves conversion and user experience
