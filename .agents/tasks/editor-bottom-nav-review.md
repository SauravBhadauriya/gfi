# Video Editor Bottom Navigation Integration

Bottom navigation toolbar now renders all buttons without gating on thumbnail load, and upload failure is non-blocking after gallery save succeeds.

The key changes address three concerns: the toolbar was previously clipping buttons when `isReady` gated the entire component; the sticker callback now validates content; and upload errors surface to the user with retry capability instead of silently failing. The export-to-gallery flow is independent of backend upload — if the server rejects the video, the file is still on the device and the user can retry without re-exporting.

**Verdict**: APPROVED

---

## High-level view

The bottom toolbar now uses `minHeight` instead of fixed `height: 65`, allowing buttons to expand if needed. PreviewActionButtons renders all buttons immediately, no loading gate — the component was always meant to be instant UI.

Sticker selection validates that content is non-null and non-empty before invoking callbacks, preventing undefined payloads from reaching the timeline.

ExportScreen separates the export and upload flows. Gallery save happens first and succeeds independently; if upload fails, the user sees a "Partial Success" alert with a retry option. Retry only attempts the upload, not the full export, so the local file is preserved. Upload progress contributes 5% of the total progress bar (0.9 to 0.95) after the 90% export.

The progress bar's animated interpolation uses `inputRange: [0, 1]` and `outputRange: ['0%', '100%']`, matching the 0–1 progress normalized by the export/upload callbacks.

Backend connection uses XMLHttpRequest to capture upload progress (fetch does not expose upload progress in React Native). The API base URL comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable with a fallback to Gullyfame's staging endpoint. Success determination checks `response.success === false` to distinguish between backend-explicit rejection and missing the field (treated as success).

### Toolbar layout and button visibility

TimelineEditor's `bottomToolbar` style uses `minHeight: 65` instead of a fixed `height: 65` (**confirmed** — line 377 in TimelineEditor.tsx). With `overflow: 'visible'`, buttons can overflow the container rather than being clipped. The ScrollView in PreviewActionButtons does not gate on `isReady` or thumbnails; all buttons render immediately (**confirmed** — PreviewActionButtons has no conditional rendering on line 73+). This matches the requirement that buttons should display even before thumbnails load, so users see the toolbar instantly rather than waiting for the image generation to complete.

### Sticker content validation

StickerButton's `handleStickerPress` and `handleEmojiPress` check for null, undefined, and empty values before calling the `onStickerSelect` callback (**confirmed** — lines 47–62 in StickerButton.tsx). If content fails validation, a console warning is logged and the callback is skipped. This prevents the timeline from receiving invalid overlay payloads. The type signature for `onStickerSelect` is `(type: 'image' | 'emoji', content: string | number) => void`, matching PreviewActionButtons' prop type and TimelineEditor's expectation (**confirmed** — interfaces align across files).

### Export and upload lifecycle

ExportScreen uses two independent flows: export-to-gallery and upload-to-server. Export happens first (lines 102–134 in ExportScreen.tsx). On success, the video is saved to the device gallery via MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync, and `exportedUri` is set for potential retry. Upload then runs as a separate try-catch block (lines 136–148) without blocking the gallery save. If upload fails, the error is caught, logged, and stored in `uploadError`. The alert changes based on upload status: success shows "✅ Success!", failure shows "⚠️ Partial Success" with a "Retry Upload" button (**confirmed** — lines 149–177).

The retry flow (`handleRetryUpload`, lines 179–217) re-attempts the upload using the same `exportedUri` without calling `exportAndCombineClips` again, so re-export is avoided and the local file is reused.

### Progress tracking

Progress bar uses `Animated.interpolate` with `inputRange: [0, 1]` and `outputRange: ['0%', '100%']` (**confirmed** — lines 223–227 in ExportScreen.tsx). Export occupies 0–0.9, upload occupies 0.9–0.95, and gallery save uses 0.95–1. The `onProgress` callback from `uploadVideo` receives a normalized value (0–1) and is scaled within the upload window (lines 140, 207). This matches the requirement for `inputRange: [0, 1]`.

### Backend upload implementation

`videoApiService.ts` exports `uploadVideo`, which uses XMLHttpRequest for upload progress tracking (**confirmed** — lines 20–66). The function accepts a local file URI, metadata object, and optional progress callback. FormData is populated with the video file and metadata fields (title, clips, duration, width, height). The `xhr.upload.onprogress` event computes `event.loaded / event.total` and passes the 0–1 normalized value to the progress callback.

Success determination (lines 41–52): on HTTP 2xx, the response JSON is parsed. If `response.success === false`, the promise rejects with the backend's error message. Otherwise, the promise resolves with `success: true`. If JSON parsing fails (line 53), a warning is logged but success is assumed (graceful fallback for HTTP 2xx with unparseable body).

API base URL comes from `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` with fallback to `https://gullyfame.com/v1/api` (**confirmed** — line 3). Timeout is set to 120 seconds (line 64). This is non-blocking in ExportScreen: if the upload endpoint times out or returns an error, the gallery save remains successful and the user is offered retry.

### Error handling and user feedback

Export errors (non-upload) show a full alert with "Cancel" and "Retry" options, allowing the user to restart the entire export (lines 220–230 in ExportScreen.tsx). Upload errors show as "Partial Success" with "Done" and "Retry Upload" options, so the user can retry the upload without re-exporting. Retry re-uses `exportedUri`, avoiding redundant video processing.

If retry also fails, another alert is shown with "Cancel" and "Retry Again" options (lines 209–217), allowing multiple retry attempts without re-exporting.

<details>
<summary>File map</summary>

- **TimelineEditor.tsx**: Updated `bottomToolbar` style to use `minHeight: 65` (not fixed height); removed `isReady` gate from PreviewActionButtons; passed `onSelectOverlay` callback with correct signature `(type: 'image' | 'emoji', content: string | number)`.

- **PreviewActionButtons.tsx**: All buttons render immediately without loading guards. Music library handler added for `MusicButton` with proper permission requests. All button callbacks wired with correct prop types, including `onSticker` signature.

- **StickerButton.tsx**: Added validation in `handleStickerPress` and `handleEmojiPress` to check for null/undefined/empty content before invoking `onStickerSelect`.

- **ExportScreen.tsx**: Split export and upload into independent flows. Added `uploadError` and `uploadRetrying` state. Upload runs non-blocking after gallery save. Added `handleRetryUpload` to retry upload without re-exporting. Progress bar uses `inputRange: [0, 1]`.

- **videoApiService.ts**: Implemented `uploadVideo` using XMLHttpRequest for upload progress. Uses `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` with fallback. Validates `response.success === false` for rejection. Returns `UploadResult` type with success and optional videoId.
