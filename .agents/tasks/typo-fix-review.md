# Typo Fix Verification Review

## Summary

All 10 typos from the typo-fix-plan have been correctly fixed in the Postman API collection file. The changes are isolated to a single JSON artifact file (documentation), with no impact on source code, no syntax errors introduced, and no unrelated changes bundled in the commit. Verification confirms corrected spellings are present and old misspellings have been removed.

**Watch for:** None — this is a clean, straightforward typo fix with no concerns.

**Verdict**: APPROVED

## High-level view

The commit fixes 10 spelling mistakes isolated to the Postman collection file — a static API documentation artifact. All instances of "Managment" → "Management", "Compitition" → "Competition", and "Sponsers" → "Sponsors" have been applied correctly across folder/collection names and request labels. No source code was modified, no configuration changed, and no build-breaking edits were introduced. The ESLint check passed with no new errors.

### Scope and Integrity

The diff covers exactly two files: the Postman collection file (18 lines changed) and a verification report added to task notes. No source code modifications, no configuration changes, no imports or exports touched. The changes are purely cosmetic corrections to documentation artifact strings.

### Typo Fixes Verification

All 10 typos listed in typo-fix-plan.md have been applied:

- Line 2033: "User Managment" → "User Management" ✓
- Line 3021: "Compitition Managment" → "Competition Management" ✓
- Line 4016: "Sponsers Managment" → "Sponsors Management" ✓
- Line 4019: "get sponsers" → "get sponsors" ✓
- Line 4045: "get sponsers" → "get sponsors" ✓
- Line 4102: "get sponsers by id" → "get sponsors by id" ✓
- Line 4129: "get sponsers by id" → "get sponsors by id" ✓
- Line 4324: "update sponsers by id" → "update sponsors by id" ✓
- Line 4885: "Reports Managment" → "Reports Management" ✓

Total: 9 distinct fixes across 10 instances (one line contained two typos: "Compitition" and "Managment").

Grep verification confirms no remnants of misspellings remain in the collection file; corrected spellings are present (43 matches for Management/Competition/Sponsors patterns).

### Build Integrity

The TypeScript compiler runs without new errors attributable to this change. Pre-existing path resolution errors (Cannot find module '@/lib/*') are unrelated to the Postman collection file and were not introduced by this commit.

### No Scope Creep

Diff inspection confirms this is a pure typo fix. No refactoring, no logic changes, no new features. The verification report added to the task directory is appropriate documentation of the work completed.
